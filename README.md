# Bachelor Semester Project 5
# SmartSparks - A Crowdsourcing App for Companies

Student: Iris Pascale Kremer (0180537960)
PAT: Steffen Rothkugel

## Project Description

Crowdsourcing is a powerful and sometimes underestimated technique to gather data from the crowd. It can be used for instance in scientific research to gather necessary scientific data through or from the entire population, or within companies or groups of people to gather new ideas more efficiently. However, in the latter case, involving a large group of people in the common process of innovation is difficult for reasons such as lack of communication means between people and a large amount of ideas out of which the bests need to be selected. The aim of this project is to create a prototypical app which will help companies to perform crowdsourcing among their employees and eventually also their customers.
